# Web Development Training

This repo will be for training with Tre on web development. Any files that are worked on can be stored here and retrieved when needed. This will also serve as a place where we can test out ideas and improve on the development on the areas of focus.

## Layout
There is an index.html file that will serve as the structure of the webpage. All HTML elements will be developed in HTMLv5.

## Styling
The primarystyle.css file will be the primary stylesheet incorporated throught the webpage. As we prorgress further into the HTML and CSS concepts we will create seperate style sheets for each page. This isn't a best practice in CSS standards but the concept of multiple style sheets and any conflicts that might occur and how to mitigate them are necessary to practice.
